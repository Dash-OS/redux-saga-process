/*
  When parsing the reducers, we need to capture and save all the reducers into
  a single SharedSchema.  This allows us to build the reducers in a way that will
  avoid conflict as much as possible (or at least be as predictable as possible)
  as we bring the reducers together to form a final reducer to send to redux.

  If the user defines an array for their config: { reduces: [ 'key1', 'key2' ] }
  then their reducer is expected to be an object mapping to the reducers
  { key1: <reducer>, key2: <reducer> }.  Otherwise the reducer is just the given
  value.

  We are not actually compiling the reducers at this point.  This is so that we can
  maintain a pure "SharedSchema" of our values that will allow us to better work with
  the environment.

  In addition, we also extract the initialState value, if given so that we can bring
  those values in.
